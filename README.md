Shiyun (She/Her/Hers) is a Master’s student at the University of Chicago, with a multidisciplinary undergraduate background in Communication, Psychology, and Economics.
Her research interests lie in exploring the historical change and regional variation of norms and values through the lens of cultural evolution. Additionally, she seeks to investigate the implications of misalignment on individuals when they struggle to identify with their socio-cultural environments.

In her spare time, Shiyun likes watching dog🐶 and cat🐱 videos. (Seriously, she's a fan of Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.)
